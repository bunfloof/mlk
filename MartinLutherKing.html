In his 1967 "Steeler Lecture," Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." The "Steeler Lecture" was one of five speeches in "The Trumpet of Conscience".</font>

The meaning of this quote is that while the ugly and bad things your enemies may say about you may hurt at the present time, you will eventually forget the person along with what they said. But if your friends are silent when you need their help, you need someone else to stand by you and speak up in your support that is a memory that you think you may never forget. Your enemies will always hate and strike you in any way possible to hurt you and will always seek to harm or destroy you. And there will be those that take advantage of you or your situation to further their own wants and needs. You know this as a person, that your enemies want the worst for you. Seeing your friends that you know and love not come to your defense or help you will always hurt more. Friends are there to help you. If they don't, then they are not your true friends. </font></p>
